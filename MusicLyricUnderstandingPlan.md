# Music Lyrics Understanding Fine-Tuning Plan

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines how to fine-tune a language model to specialize in understanding music lyrics and their relationships to artists, genres, and musical contexts using the 5M Songs Lyrics dataset. The model will transform from providing generic text analysis to offering deep insights into musical themes, artist styles, and genre characteristics.

## Target Demo Scenario

**Before Fine-tuning:**
```
User: "Analyze these lyrics: 'Started from the bottom now we're here...'"
Model: "This appears to be about progress and achievement. It's a motivational message."
```

**After Fine-tuning:**
```
User: "Analyze these lyrics: [example lyrics about progress and success]"
Model: "This exhibits classic hip-hop success narrative structure typical of 2010s rap. Key analysis:

**Artist Style**: Introspective approach mixing vulnerability with triumph, characteristic of melodic hip-hop
**Genre Elements**: Hip-hop braggadocio combined with accessible melody, typical of mainstream rap evolution
**Lyrical Themes**: Rags-to-riches narrative, loyalty themes, authenticity in success
**Cultural Context**: Reflects broader cultural themes of self-made success in contemporary hip-hop
**Similar Works**: Shares thematic elements with other success narratives in modern rap"
```

```python
from peft import LoraConfig, get_peft_model

lora_config = LoraConfig(
    r=128,                   # High rank for maximum adaptation capacity
    lora_alpha=256,          # Strong adaptation signal for fast learning
    target_modules=[         # Comprehensive layer targeting
        "q_proj", "k_proj", "v_proj", "o_proj",
        "gate_proj", "up_proj", "down_proj",
        "lm_head"            # Critical for music vocabulary
    ],
    lora_dropout=0.05,       # Minimal dropout for fast convergence
    bias="none",
    task_type="CAUSAL_LM"
)
```

```python
# analysis/dataset_analysis.py
import pandas as pd
from datasets import load_dataset

def analyze_5m_songs_dataset():
    """Comprehensive analysis of the 5M songs dataset"""
    dataset = load_dataset("rajtripathi/5M-Songs-Lyrics")
    
    # Quality metrics
    avg_lyric_length = dataset['train']['lyrics'].str.len().mean()
    genre_distribution = dataset['train']['genre'].value_counts()
    artist_frequency = dataset['train']['artist'].value_counts()
    
    # Identify high-quality subsets
    # - Complete lyrics (not truncated)
    # - Accurate metadata
    # - Diverse genre representation
    
    return quality_report
```

**Step 2: Create Training Subsets**
```python
def create_training_subsets(dataset):
    """Create balanced training data for music understanding"""
    
    # Stratified sampling by genre
    genres = ['Hip-Hop', 'Rock', 'Pop', 'Country', 'R&B', 'Electronic', 'Folk']
    samples_per_genre = 2000
    
    # Artist diversity (max 50 songs per artist to avoid overfitting)
    max_songs_per_artist = 50
    
    # Quality filtering
    min_lyric_length = 100  # Filter out incomplete lyrics
    max_lyric_length = 5000  # Filter out extremely long entries
    
    return filtered_dataset
```

# Leverage PyTorch Lightning for efficient training
import pytorch_lightning as pl

class MusicUnderstandingModel(pl.LightningModule):
    """PyTorch Lightning module for music understanding"""
    
    def __init__(self, base_model, lora_config):
        super().__init__()
        self.model = get_peft_model(base_model, lora_config)
    
    def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):
        outputs = self.model(**batch)
        loss = outputs.loss
        self.log('train_loss', loss)
        return loss
    
    def configure_optimizers(self):
        return torch.optim.AdamW(self.parameters(), lr=1e-4)
```

### Distributed Training
```python
# Utilize distributed training across 3 nodes
def setup_distributed_training():
    """Configure distributed training for music model"""
    
    # Use the same distributed setup as PyTorchJob
    # Leverage 3-node setup for faster training
    # Implement gradient synchronization for LoRA parameters
    pass
```
